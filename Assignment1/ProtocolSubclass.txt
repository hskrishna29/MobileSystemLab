Protocols : 

Set of methods that can be used by objects of any class, in a given situation.

- Used to declare methods or properties which are independent of any class.
- The methods in the protocol can be implemented by any class
  directly without inheritance.
- A class that declares a protocol must implement all the methods in that protocol.

eg.
	@interface shape:NSObject
	{
	-(void)getDimension;
	}
	@protocol size
	-(float)volume:(float)side;
	@end

Here shape must implement the volume method in the protocol size.

Subclass:

Subclasses can inherit methods from their super class and override them.
A subclass unlike protocol, need not implement all methods of its super class.

eg.
	@interface circle:shape
	{
	//circle may or may not implement the getDimension method in shape.
	}
